    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        · Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is
            ready to receive traffic. Without it, the Pod is risking to receive
            traffic before it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and
            can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.

        · Container has the same readiness and liveness probe
            Using the same probe for liveness and readiness is very likely
            dangerous. Generally it's better to avoid the livenessProbe than
            re-using the readinessProbe.

        · Container is missing a readinessProbe
            A readinessProbe should be used to indicate when the service is

            traffic before it has booted. It's also used during rollouts, and
            can prevent downtime if a new version of the application is failing.

    [CRITICAL] Pod Probes
        · Container has the same readiness and liveness probe
            Using the same probe for liveness and readiness is very likely
            dangerous. Generally it's better to avoid the livenessProbe than
            re-using the readinessProbe.
